#Note2Key

Using a Fast Fourier Transform to identify notes based on their frequencies, this application translates notes (from a keyboard or other musical instrument) into keyboard keypresses. This allows you to use your musical instrument with music software or for playing games.

##How to use

Select the recording (wave/in) device to use (you can use a microphone or a keyboard directly connected to the line-in/mic jack) and then press the Start Button. Each played note corresponds to a simulated keyboard keypress.
